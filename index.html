          <p align="left">Dr. Xin Liang is a tenure-track assistant professor with the <a href="https://www.engr.uky.edu/research-faculty/departments/computer-science">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.uky.edu">University of Kentucky (UKY)</a>. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.ucr.edu">University of California, Riverside</a> in 2019. Prior to that, he received his B.S. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn">Peking University</a> in 2014, with a minor in Math and Applied Math. During his Ph.D. studies, he worked as student interns in the Extreme Scale Resilience Group and the Parallel Extreme-Scale Data Analytics Team at <a href="https://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)</a>, the Scalable Machine Learning Group at <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)</a>, and the Data Science at Scale Team at <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/">Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)</a>. Prior to joining UKY, he worked as an assistant professor at <a href="https://www.mst.edu">Missouri University of Science and Technology</a> and Computer/Data Scientist in the Workflow Systems Group at <a href="https://www.ornl.gov">Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)</a>.</p>
          <p align="left">Dr. Liang's research interests lie broadly in the areas of high-performance computing, parallel and distributed systems, scientific data management, large-scale data analytics, and distributed machine learning. He has published in many highly competitive conferences and journals such as IEEE/ACM SC, ACM HPDC, ACM PPoPP, ACM ICS, IEEE IPDPS, ACM PACT, IEEE BigData, IEEE Cluster, IEEE TPDS etc. He has received <I>Dissertation Year Fellowship (DYP)</I> from UCR and <I>Best Paper Award</I> from IEEE Cluster 2018. While working at ORNL, he led the ESAMR project funded by the <I>Director's Research and Development (DRD)</I> program as principal investigator. He is one of the key developers of SZ and major contributors of MGARD, which are two widely used data reduction software in the scientific computing community. More details about Dr. Liang can be found in his <a href="cv.pdf" target="_blank" data-content="cv.pdf" data-type="external" rel="undefined">CV</a></span>.</p>

          <p align="left"><b>Dr. Liang is always looking for self-motivated students to work on high-performance computing, scientific data management, and big data analytics. If you're interested in his research, please contact him at <a href="mailto:xliang@uky.edu">xliang@uky.edu</a>. According to <a href="https://csrankings.org">CS ranking</a>, UKY is ranked <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?hpc&us">36th considering the last ten years (2013-2023)</a> and <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2016/toyear/2023/index?hpc&us">24th considering the last seven years (2016-2023)</a> among all the US universities in the area of high-performance computing.</b></p>
