                <li>Project description: Scientific simulations and instruments are producing an unprecedented amount of data that overwhelms the network and storage systems. These data have to be stored at remote sites or moved to secondary storage for archival purposes due to the limited capacity in high end parallel file systems. This poses grand challenges to fetching the data for post hoc data analytics, as the data movement bandwidth across wide area networks or from secondary systems is very limited. This project bridges this gap by developing scalable software to realize data polymorphism, a novel paradigm that allows for variable representations of the same data under different scenarios and use cases, to enable on demand data provision with reduced data movement cost. The success of this project is expected to significantly reduce the time needed to gain scientific insights from data for a wide range of applications, thus advancing scientific discoveries in domains including climatology, cosmology, fusion energy science, and ptychography. This contributes to resolving a wide range of important societal problems, including weather forecasting, galaxy surveys, electric generation, and material design. Furthermore, an integrated education program is developed for workforce development and broadening participation in advanced cyberinfrastructure.</li>

                <li>Project description: This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 EPSCoR Research Fellows project will provide a fellowship to an Assistant professor and training for a graduate student at the University of Kentucky Research Foundation. This work will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the de facto standard to perform communication and scale applications on high-performance computing systems. The performance of MPI is crucial to various downstream applications, including scientific simulations, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence. However, as the recent development of GPUs continues to outpace that of commodity networks, large-size data transfer is becoming the major performance bottleneck in state-of-the-art MPI libraries. This work aims to tackle this problem by developing a performant and scalable MPI library through integrated data compression, which is critical to fully exploit the power of current and next-generation computing systems. The success of this project will allow for accelerated executions of scientific code and data analytics, reducing the time to scientific insights for applications running on large-scale GPU-based computing systems. This will help advance scientific discoveries across a wide range of computer and computational disciplines. The deliverables of this project will be made publicly accessible to the community to enhance the research and engineering cyberinfrastructure in broader domains. In addition, this project will contribute to the education and workforce development for advanced cyberinfrastructure through the training of graduate students.</li>

                <li>Project description: Today's large-scale simulations are producing vast amounts of data that are revolutionizing scientific thinking and practices. For instance, a fusion simulation can produce 200 petabytes of data in a single run, while a climate simulation can generate 260 terabytes of data every 16 seconds with a 1 square kilometer resolution. As the disparity between data generation rates and available I/O bandwidths continues to grow, data storage and movement are becoming significant bottlenecks for extreme-scale scientific simulations in terms of in situ and post hoc analysis and visualization. The disparity necessitates data compression, which compresses large-scale simulations data in situ, and decompresses data in situ and/or post hoc for analysis and exploration. On the other hand, a critical step in extracting insight from large-scale simulations involves the definition, extraction, and evaluation of features of interest. Topological data analysis has provided powerful tools to capture features from scientific data in turbulent combustion, astronomy, climate science, computational physics and chemistry, and ecology. While lossy compression is leveraged to address the big data challenges, most existing lossy compressors are agnostic of and thus fail to preserve topological features that are essential to scientific discoveries. This project aims to research and develop advanced lossy compression techniques and software that preserve topological features in data for in situ and post hoc analysis and visualization at extreme scales. The success of this project will promote scientific research on driving applications in cosmology, climate, and fusion by enabling efficient and effective compression for scientific data, and the impact scales to other science and engineering disciplines. Furthermore, the research products of this project will be integrated into visualization and parallel processing curricula, disseminated via research and training workshops, and used to attract underrepresented students for broadening participation in computing.</li>

                <li>Project description: Effective management of scientific data produced by extreme-scale simulations and instruments is crucial for advancing scientific discoveries. Due to the scale of data and the diverse requirements of scientific analytics, there is a growing need to manage data in a progressive manner, such that users can stream as much data as they need to carry out their data analytics with reduced data movement and computation. However, little effort has been put into creating robust and scalable cyberinfrastructure services that link the recent algorithmic innovations in progressive methods with scientific data analytics, leaving these capabilities inaccessible to scientists. This project aims to develop a sustainable framework ProDM that supports the progressive management of scientific data to facilitate its use in scientific applications. The success of this project will enable new scientific research and novel findings by providing a new way to manage and analyze data. Furthermore, outcomes of this project will be delivered as publicly available software to enhance research cyberinfrastructure, promote education and teaching, and broaden participation in computing.</li>

While this evolution has been largely supported by the rapid improvements in advanced GPU cyberinfrastructure, comprehensive training materials are generally absent that combine application-driven deep learning techniques with the implementation of such techniques using the GPU cyberinfrastructure. To fill in this gap, this project develops an online workshop that comprises of a set of interdisciplinary cutting-edge training sessions offered by six faculty members from five disciplines. With a focus on the latest innovations in GPU-based deep learning systems and applications, this workshop fosters a community of the next-generation cyberinfrastructure users and contributors, who can use, develop, and improve advanced GPU cyberinfrastructure for their deep learning research. Such training efforts enhance the knowledge of the deep learning and GPU cyberinfrastructure workforce, and subsequently contribute to the solutions of important scientific and societal problems, including hydrographic mapping in geography, space environment nowcasting in aerospace, and autonomous driving and traffic monitoring in transportation. The workshop will also attract trainees from underrepresented groups, including minority students and researchers from rural areas.</li>

                <li>Scientific simulations and instruments are producing data at volumes and velocities that overwhelm network and storage systems. Although error-controlled lossy compressors have been employed to mitigate these data issues, many scientists still feel reluctant to adopt them because these compressors provide no guarantee on the accuracy of downstream analysis results derived from raw data. This project aims to fill this gap by developing a trust-driven lossy data compression infrastructure capable of strictly controlling the errors in downstream analysis theoretically and practically to facilitate the use of data reduction in scientific applications. Success of this project will promote the progress of science in multiple disciplines via effective data reduction, and contribute to resolving important societal problems including electric generation, weather forecasting, material design, and transportation. Moreover, this project will contribute to the growth and development of future generations of scientists and engineers through educational and engagement activities, including development of new curriculum and recruitment of K-12 students.</li>

To achieve this goal, our multiprecision refactoring framework will refactor scientific data in a progressive fashion based on importance, and will be optimized on ORNL’s accelerated nodes. The framework will offer on-demand accuracy to minimize data movement, and time spent in analysis algorithms on edge and HPC resources. Although this is a general framework, we will validate its effectiveness on CNMS data generated from the scanning transmission electron microscopy and DCA++ simulation data generated on Summit. Upon success, it can be utilized at other ORNL facilities such as SNS, HFIR, and OLCF. The progressive data representation defined in this project (i.e., the refactored data) is complementary to other important ORNL initiatives such as the Federated Instrument Initiative and the Scalable Data Infrastructure for Science Initiative and can be integrated in edge systems and distributed storage infrastructures to allow for efficient and scalable data collection, storage, and sharing.</li>

These challenges arise from the deepening of the memory hierarchy and inclusion of fast, nonvolatile storage within the HPC system; the widening ratio of peak FLOPS to I/O bandwidth; and the increasing ubiquity of computation accelerators. Moreover, the breadth of science performed on DOE advanced computing resources is growing and new motifs of investigation are emerging, including those involving experimental and observational data and artificial intelligence (AI).

                <li>Abstract: Long-running large-scale simulations and high-resolution, high-frequency instrument detectors are generating extremely large volumes of data at a high rate. While reliable scientific computing is routinely achieved at small scale, it becomes remarkably difficult at exascale due to both an increased number of disruptions as the machines become larger and more complex from, for example, component failures and the big data challenge. The VeloC/SZ project addresses these challenges by focusing on ensuring high reliability for long-running exascale simulations and reducing the data while keeping important scientific outcomes intact.</li>
